Hello1;GC9A5979.jpg;Eland-headed snake;""This sculpture depicts a snake (python) with the head of an antelope (eland). The sculpture weaves in and out of the wall. The sculpture is inspired by the painted rock art imagery of the southern African San. 

The rock surface acted as a veil between the real and spirit worlds and that the images entering or exiting natural features in the rock surface were actually entering or exiting the spirit world. Cracks and crevices of rock surfaces (as well as waterholes and termite mounds) linked the spirit world to the real world. Many rock paintings and engravings incorporate natural features of the rock surface, with some painted images appearing to enter or exit cracks, crevices or steps in the rock surface. 

The argument was supported by the testimony of Manqindi Dyantyi, an old woman living in the former Transkei territory, whose father was the last San painter. She described how the San used to touch the paintings during dances to harness the supernatural energy within them.

Supernatural potency is called n|om by the Kalahari Ju|’hoansi, and !gi by the |Xam of the Karoo and has been described as being like an electrical current. Certain animals associated with water, fertility, blood, fat, and transformation are particularly potent. These animals include the eland, termites, snakes, and bees.

Hello15;IMG_20190610_144415_033.jpg;Axis Mundi;"""This conceptual piece speaks to the tiered cosmos in San religious thought. Termites emerge from the mound and ascend into the heavens along the axis mundi in the form of a tree. As they ascend, they transform into therianthropic (part human, part animal) creatures. These wooden creatures are derived from San rock paintings and they are sculpted in a flattened relief, remaining faithful to the original two-dimensional artworks. 

Landscapes were meaningful and complex places for the San living in the past, as they are for those San still living today. Small, inconspicuous and even invisible features of landscape, such as shallow water pans, low rocky outcrops and termite mounds were also seen as important. These places allowed access to the spirit world. The supernatural world is described, paradoxically, as being both below ground and in the sky above. Only certain San ritual specialists, known as owners-of-energy, can enter this alternative world. Once there, they encounter strange animals, the spirits of dead friends and relatives, and, on occasion, god. In turn, certain inhabitants of the spirit realm can visit this world by emerging from the same points of entry used by ritual specialists. It is particularly during the trance dance that movement between the two worlds is facilitated.

Many of the experiences reported by San in trance may seem strange and peculiar. For example, some report that they change into animal-form during the dance. This experience of transformation is often depicted in rock art. Images of therianthropes – part human, part animal – are abundant in rock art sites throughout southern Africa. While seemingly peculiar, this type of experience is reported by people throughout the world when in a state of trance.

The images tell the story of the conflict with Boer colonial authorities who were trying to push the Hananwa from their land, and show people being taken away in trains (monsters) to work in the mines or put in prison.

Replica made by Lawrence Raubenheimer.

This protest art was painted in the late 1800's by the Hananwa (Bahananwa, Xananwa), now Northern Sotho, during the Maleboch war of 1894. The images tell the story of the conflict with Boer colonial authorities who were trying to push the Hananwa from their land, and show people being taken away in trains (monsters) to work in the mines or put in prison. Conflicts occured over land and were between Afrikaans famers and the local Hananwa.

Hello99;Origins_REA_10.JPG;The Rock Engraving Archive ;"""This is the biggest collection of rock engravings on display in Africa, housing almost 80 engraved boulders. 
Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the geometric images were made by migrating Khoe pastoralists, mapping their arrival and spread along water courses of South Africa. Some researchers argue that without dates it is impossible to resolve this question and alternative interpretations are offered, from example that the geometrics may rather simply represent the spread and change of ideas amongst the San.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the geometric images were made by migrating Khoe pastoralists, mapping their arrival and spread along water courses of South Africa. Some researchers argue that without dates it is impossible to resolve this question and alternative interpretations are offered, from example that the geometrics may rather simply represent the spread and change of ideas amongst the San.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen.

Hello115;RARI_RE_00_(1).JPG;Pecked rock engraving of an eland ;"""This engraved boulder forms part of the biggest collection of rock engravings on display in Africa (The Rock Engraving Archive), consisting of almost 80 engraved boulders. 

Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the geometric images were made by migrating Khoe pastoralists, mapping their arrival and spread along water courses of South Africa. Some researchers argue that without dates it is impossible to resolve this question and alternative interpretations are offered, from example that the geometrics may rather simply represent the spread and change of ideas amongst the San.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks.

These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock).

Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

This boulder, broken in half, depicts the heads of zebra. 

Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the geometric images were made by migrating Khoe pastoralists, mapping their arrival and spread along water courses of South Africa. Some researchers argue that without dates it is impossible to resolve this question and alternative interpretations are offered, from example that the geometrics may rather simply represent the spread and change of ideas amongst the San.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo.

The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

Hello146;Label_RE_2005_134_38.jpg;Stylized re-drawing of fine-lined rock engraving of an antelope;"""This engraved boulder forms part of the biggest collection of rock engravings on display in Africa (The Rock Engraving Archive), consisting of almost 80 engraved boulders. This boulder depicts an antelope, engraved by incising.

Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the geometric images were made by migrating Khoe pastoralists, mapping their arrival and spread along water courses of South Africa. Some researchers argue that without dates it is impossible to resolve this question and alternative interpretations are offered, from example that the geometrics may rather simply represent the spread and change of ideas amongst the San.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context.

During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

Hello181;Spirit world.jpg;Engraved boulders and Axis Mundi;"""Original engraved boulders in the foreground - made by the San and Khoe. 

The conceptual piece, in the background, speaks to the tiered cosmos in San religious thought. Termites emerge from the mound and ascend into the heavens along the axis mundi in the form of a tree. As they ascend, they transform into therianthropic (part human, part animal) creatures. These wooden creatures are derived from San rock paintings and they are sculpted in a flattened relief, remaining faithful to the original two-dimensional artworks. 

Landscapes were meaningful and complex places for the San living in the past, as they are for those San still living today. Small, inconspicuous and even invisible features of landscape, such as shallow water pans, low rocky outcrops and termite mounds were also seen as important. These places allowed access to the spirit world. The supernatural world is described, paradoxically, as being both below ground and in the sky above. Only certain San ritual specialists, known as owners-of-energy, can enter this alternative world. Once there, they encounter strange animals, the spirits of dead friends and relatives, and, on occasion, god. In turn, certain inhabitants of the spirit realm can visit this world by emerging from the same points of entry used by ritual specialists. It is particularly during the trance dance that movement between the two worlds is facilitated.

Many of the experiences reported by San in trance may seem strange and peculiar. For example, some report that they change into animal-form during the dance. This experience of transformation is often depicted in rock art. Images of therianthropes – part human, part animal – are abundant in rock art sites throughout southern Africa. While seemingly peculiar, this type of experience is reported by people throughout the world when in a state of trance.

The San believe the eland is the animal with the most supernatural potency (called n|om by the Kalahari Ju|’hoansi, and !gi by the |xam of the Karoo). This power can be best imagined like electricity – useful to harness in the right amount, but dangerous if you receive too much. The San harness the power of the eland so that they can heal the sick. 

The rock surface acted as a veil between the real and spirit worlds and that the images entering or exiting natural features in the rock surface were actually entering or exiting the spirit world. Manqindi Dyantyi, an old woman living in the former Transkei territory, whose father was the last San painter, described how the San used to touch the paintings during dances to harness the supernatural energy within them.""";San Hunter-Gatherer;Eastern Cape, South Africa;;Painting;Rock painting;Sandstone rock, pigment, ochre;Thomas Dowson;http://sarada.co.za/#/library/;Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand. www.sarada.co.za

Dances are often spontaneous, and can be initiated for play by children. Adults join after nightfall and the dance becomes more intense. Only the most experienced dancers enter trance and are called “owners of energy”. Dancing is painful and entering into trance is frightening to some people. The trance dancers and the spirit world are frequently depicted in San rock art. 

At the healing dances, the ritual specialists use supernatural potency to send their spirits on journeys to the otherworld where they plead with their god for the souls of the sick. Supernatural potency is called n|om by the Kalahari Ju|’hoansi, and !gi by the |Xam of the Karoo and has been described as being like an electrical current. The invisible energy floats through the air and dancers harness it through a spot on the back of the neck, called the n/ao spot. The energy travels down the spine to the stomach, where it is said to “boil”, before moving back up to the head, where it explodes, catapulting the dancer into the spirit world. Once in the spirit world, dancers must perform various tasks for the benefit of their community.

Hello210;RE_00_00_62.JPG;Fine-line rock engraving depicting the head of an eland;"""This engraved boulder forms part of the biggest collection of rock engravings on display in Africa (The Rock Engraving Archive), consisting of almost 80 engraved boulders. 

Many of the fine-lined or pecked animal engravings were created by San hunter-gatherers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the geometric images were made by migrating Khoe pastoralists, mapping their arrival and spread along water courses of South Africa. Some researchers argue that without dates it is impossible to resolve this question and alternative interpretations are offered, from example that the geometrics may rather simply represent the spread and change of ideas amongst the San.

Rock engravings, like paintings, have a history of being removed from their original context. During the 1800s travellers and naturalists removed rock engravings from local sites to add to European collections. The art, along with other artefacts, and animal and human remains featured as curiosities in museums around the world. From the 1920s to the 1960s many painted and engraved panels were removed to museum collections, as it was believed that this was the best way to protect them. These engraved boulders were collected from various localities around South Africa including the Magaliesberg, North West Province, the Joe Gqabi municipal district of the Eastern Cape, Krugersdorp District, Rustenberg district. Most of these pieces were housed in Museum Africa, from where they were moved to Wits University, and placed under the curatorship of the Rock Art Research Institute in 2005. In the 1960s Dr Friede and Prof. Mason under the auspices of the South African Archaeological Society assembled a major collection of rock engravings that had been removed from their original location at sites in the Magaliesberg, and around the Klerksdorp and Schweizer-Reneke region of the North West Province. The engravings were arranged for exhibition to the public in a special enclosure in the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens (now the Johannesburg Zoo). This was officially opened on 5th September 1970 as the Museum of South African Rock Art. However, the exhibit, curated by Africana Museum (now Museum Africa), was difficult to maintain and staff grew increasingly uncomfortable about the social implications of displaying indigenous art in a zoo. In the early 1990s the rock engraving exhibit was closed, and the smaller pieces were taken to Museum Africa, because the museum’s floors were unable to support the heavier boulders, 36 were left displayed at the Zoo. Over time the rock engravings exposed at the Zoo became weathered and covered in moss and lichen. Anxiety over their neglect led, in May 2000, to their removal to Wits University under the curation of the the Rock Art Research Institute and with funding from the Department of Arts and Culture. Between 2000 and 2004 a team of conservators worked on cleaning, conserving and restoring these engravings. Today, every effort is made to conserve rock engravings in their original context. However, engravings are salvaged when mining and other developments place them under threat. 

The majority of the engravings are on dolerite rocks. Just a few are on blue wonderstone. Various techniques have been used to engrave the images. These include pecking and fine-line engraving using a sharp object (such as a harder rock). The sound that some rocks made when struck would have added to the auditory experience, and a mark would have been left each time the rock was struck. Marks from the sharpening of tools and weapons against the hard surfaces also add a layer of meaning to the rocks. 

We now have a better appreciation for how the engravings interacted with their landscapes; for example, how the experience of the art changes with the light, wind, rain, sounds and also the social perspective of the viewer. Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

With the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI), Origins Centre aims to facilitate the collection and organising of information and interpretations of about these displaced pieces of art and the people who created them.

Some of the engravings can only be seen with carefully positioned lighting, as would have been the case in their natural landscape - at certain times of day the engravings would have 'magically' appeared.

With the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI), Origins Centre aims to facilitate the collection and organising of information and interpretations of about these displaced pieces of art and the people who created them.

Once an altered state is induced, the brain begins to generate its own imagery. Initially, the images are luminous geometric forms that appear animated. These images are construed in terms of cultural and individual preferences; a geometric grid pattern, for example, may be interpreted by a San person as a honeycomb while a westerner may interpret the same pattern as the layout of a city. During the final stages of an altered state, people experience complex physical sensations, such as the sensation of extra digits (polymelia), dissolving of limbs, or a feeling of transformation into animal form (therianthropy).""";San Hunter-Gatherer;KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa;0;Painting;Rock painting;Sandstone rock, pigment, ochre;Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand;http://sarada.co.za/#/library/;Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand. www.sarada.co.za

According to many San religious beliefs, upon death all people become spirits-of-the-dead; they become shadows of their former selves. They then live in the spirit world for eternity where life continues much as it did on earth. Eventually they become bored with the same, endless existence and long for the living. Their longing drives them from the spirit world, through places like water holes or termite mounds, to the edge of the flickering firelight where they shoot arrows of sickness into people. The spirits-of-the-dead also try to steal the souls of young, attractive people. Ritual specialists must undertake the difficult journey, through trance, to the spirit world in order to retrieve the stolen soul.""";San Hunter-Gatherer;Eastern Cape, South Africa;0;Painting;Rock painting;Sandstone rock, pigment, ochre;Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand;http://sarada.co.za/#/library/;Rock Art Research Institute, University of the Witwatersrand. www.sarada.co.za

In times of drought, a ritual specialist must enter into a trance and then visit the spirit world by travelling through a waterhole, where they must lure the ferocious rain-animal out. Sometimes buchu – an aromatic herb – is used to soothe the rain-animal, making it easier to capture the creature. 
Once caught, the animal is guided into the real world, where it is taken to the place where rain is needed. It is then either killed or wounded and its blood and milk fall as rain.

The broom cluster fig is a rock-splitting, shade tree that reaches up to 35 m. It is found alongside rivers and waterways in northern and eastern South Africa, and all the way up to North Africa.

The fruits produced in summer are very sweet and are consumed fresh or as jam.
The wood of the trunk is used traditionally as part of a fire-lighting kit and for making mortars, drums, brake blocks, and bed boards. The inner bark is used to make rope. The white latex from the live growth areas of the plant is used for treating lung and throat ailments. It is also used to encourage milk production in cows.

Like other fig trees, this one relies on a symbiotic relationship with a specific wasp species which, while laying eggs inside the fig, collects pollen and pollinates other “fruit” of the same species.

YELLOWWOOD
UMSONTI
OUTENIEKWAGEELHOUT

A tall evergreen tree with sharply pointed dark green leathery leaves and smooth, flaking bark. The fleshy, edible, yellow fruits take a year to ripen. The yellowwood is a protected tree.

The Outeniqua yellowwood is the ‘Big Tree’ in the Knysna forest, reaching up to 60 m in height. Yellowwoods occur from the southern Cape to the Limpopo and also into Mozambique.

The wood is valuable and its growth rate and properties compare favourably to the exotic pine tree. It makes magnificent furniture and is highly sought after for boat-building, floorboards and roof beams. The bark is used for tanning leather and the sap is used to aid chest complaints.

Archaeologically, the resin of the tree was combined with other ingredients to glue arrow-heads to shafts for hunting weapons. When heated to a certain temperature the adhesive becomes brittle; under pressure a poisoned arrow-tip will detach from the shaft and remain in the wounded animal.

The words Podos means foot, and karpos means fruit (Greek), alluding to the fruits that are produced on fleshy stalks.

Wild dagga is a robust shrub that grows almost anywhere in South Africa.

Many sunbirds feed on the copious nectar in the aptly tubular orange or white flowers thereby pollinating the plant. The plant also attracts ants, bees, and butterflies.

Wild dagga is used to treat headaches, coughs, asthma, dysentery, fever, haemorrhoids, snakebites, tapeworm, and is used traditionally as a snake repellent. It also treats gall sickness in livestock. It is both an anti-nociceptive, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory, but is dangerous in large doses. 

The name Leonotis is derived from the Greek words leon meaning lion and -otis meaning ear. This refers to the upper lips of each flower that resemble a lion’s ear.

This tree was known for many years as Acacia karroo. It is widespread throughout southern Africa. 

The Sweet Thorn is a small to medium-sized tree which grows to height of 12m where there is good water. It is a tree of open woodland and wooded grassland, but can grow in very dry conditions.
The tree is easily recognised by its distinctive long white paired thorns and coffee coloured bark. The leaves are finely textured and dark green. The bark is red on young branches, darkening and becoming rough with age. Sometimes an attractive reddish colour can be seen in the deep bark fissures. Small birds like to build their nests in the densely thorny branches, as the thorns offer excellent protection from predators.The abundant yellow flowers appear in early summer, or after good rains. The seed pods are narrow, flat and crescent shaped. The flowers appear in early summer in a mass of yellow pompons. Many insects visit and pollinate these flowers. The seed pods are flat and crescent shaped.

V. karroo is used for chemical products, domestic uses, environmental management, fibre, food and wood. Sweet thorn gets its common name from the gum which is exuded from wounds in the bark. This pleasant tasting gum is eaten by people and animals. The gum the V. karroo was exported as a confectionary in the past as “Cape Gum”. The gum is similar to gum Arabic. The bark contains tannin which is used to tan leather to a reddish colour. The hard wood is an excellent firewood and charcoal, and is also used for fencing posts. A tough rope can be made from the inner bark of the tree. The gum, bark and leaves have been used in cold remedies as well as to help eye and wound infections.
The tree is as forage and fodder for domestic and wild animals.

It is a shrub or small to medium-sized tree which grows to height of 12m where there is good water. It is a tree of open woodland and wooded grassland, but can grow in very dry conditions.
The tree is easily recognised by its distinctive long white paired thorns and coffee coloured bark. The leaves are finely textured and dark green. The bark is red on young branches, darkening and becoming rough with age. Sometimes an attractive reddish colour can be seen in the deep bark fissures. The abundant yellow flowers appear in early summer, or after good rains. The seed pods are narrow, flat and crescent shaped. The flowers appear in early summer in a mass of yellow pompons. Small birds like to build their nests in the densely thorny branches, as the thorns offer excellent protection from predators.Many insects visit and pollinate these flowers. The seed pods are flat and crescent shaped.

V. karroo is used for chemical products, domestic uses, environmental management, fibre, food and wood. Sweet thorn gets its common name from the gum which is exuded from wounds in the bark. This pleasant tasting gum is eaten by people and animals. The gum the V. karroo was exported as a confectionary in the past as “Cape Gum”. The gum is similar to gum Arabic. The bark contains tannin which is used to tan leather to a reddish colour. The hard wood is an excellent firewood and charcoal, and is also used for fencing posts. A tough rope can be made from the inner bark of the tree. The gum, bark and leaves have been used in cold remedies as well as to help eye and wound infections.
The tree is as forage and fodder for domestic and wild animals.

This species was formerly included in the genus Acacia, but has since been moved to the genus Vachellia.

This is a medium-sized, upright, deciduous thorn tree reaching up to 10 m. The narrow upright growth and majestic stature, makes it one of the most popular thorn trees in southern Africa. Vachellia robusta occurs in a diverse range of habitats, in southern Africa it is very common in the warm dry savannas and is resistant to drought and frost. It is distributed from tropical Africa southwards to Namibia, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. Vachellia robusta is commonly found in open forests and woodlands, often near streams. The main stem is grey to blackish with rough hairy branches. The white thorns are straight and paired. The heartwood is pinkish brown to reddish brown and distinctly demarcated from the wide whitish sapwood. The wood is brittle and moderately durable and rarely used for furniture. 

Flowers are creamy white pompons appear together with or after the new leaves in spring, followed by the dehiscent greyish brown, straight and broad, seed pods adorning the tree.
The leaves are browsed by mammals, the strongly scented flowers attract bees and butterflies, and many other insects. Small birds like to build their nests in the densely thorny branches, as the thorns offer excellent protection from predators.

This tree has many medicinal uses. The powdered root is applied to swellings, and the roots have been used to treat dysmenorrhea, infertility in women and bilharzia. The stem bark is used to treat gonorrhea, abdominal pain and skin conditions. The leaves are used to treat snake bites. 

Vachellia robusta is modulated by nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium soil bacteria, which fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) and convert it to ammonia (NH4+) - a form of nitrogen usable by plants. The bacteria benefit by having access to organic compounds that the plant produces through photosynthesis.

This unique, evergreen tree mostly occurs inland in South Africa, favouring rocky environments. It grows in crevices filled with natural organic humus and compost. It is frost-tolerant and drought resistant. It is a short, thick-set tree, rarely exceeding 5 m in height. This plant is considered a pachycaul succulent on the basis of its swollen stem base or tuber which forms early in plants grown from seed. Roots are also thick and swollen. The tree is slow growing.

The large, digitately compound, cabbage blue-green leaves are one of its most distinctive features. The blue leaf colour is in some part due to the thick waxy layers on the leaves, which helps protect the plant against severe frosts. In summer the trees bear small, green, stalked flowers; in short dense spikes, making up a large, branched inflorescence at the end of the trunk or branches. Flowers are followed by fleshy and purple-maroon fruits.

The name Cussonia was given by Carl Peter Thunberg to commemorate the French botanist Pierre Cusson (1727-1783). It is believed that the name 'kiepersol' comes from the Portuguese (Quinta-sol) or Indian (Kitty-sol), words for a parasol or sunshade. 

The flowers are pollinated by an enormous variety of insects that have wings e.g. bees, wasps, flies. When they are in full flower it sounds like a beehive. Birds feed on the ripened, black seed.
The wood is soft and light and was used for the brake-blocks of wagons. The leaves provide good fodder for stock and the Zulu name refers to this tree as goats' food. The thick root can be peeled and eaten raw as food or as a source of water. It may have been used to treat infections, inflammation and malaria.

The wood is valuable and its growth rate and properties compare favourably to the exotic pine tree. It makes magnificent furniture and is highly sought after for boat-building, floorboards and roof beams. The bark is used for tanning leather and the sap is used to aid chest complaints.

Archaeologically, the resin of the tree was combined with other ingredients to glue arrow-heads to shafts for hunting weapons. When heated to a certain temperature the adhesive becomes brittle and will break under pressure, leaving a poisoned arrow-tip in the wounded animal.

This tree was known for many years as Acacia karroo. It is widespread throughout southern Africa. 

The Sweet Thorn is a small to medium-sized tree which grows to height of 12m where there is good water. It is a tree of open woodland and wooded grassland, but can grow in very dry conditions.
The tree is easily recognised by its distinctive long white paired thorns and coffee coloured bark. The leaves are finely textured and dark green. The bark is red on young branches, darkening and becoming rough with age. Sometimes an attractive reddish colour can be seen in the deep bark fissures. Small birds like to build their nests in the densely thorny branches, as the thorns offer excellent protection from predators.The abundant yellow flowers appear in early summer, or after good rains. The seed pods are narrow, flat and crescent shaped. The flowers appear in early summer in a mass of yellow pompons. Many insects visit and pollinate these flowers. The seed pods are flat and crescent shaped.

V. karroo is used for chemical products, domestic uses, environmental management, fibre, food and wood. Sweet thorn gets its common name from the gum which is exuded from wounds in the bark. This pleasant tasting gum is eaten by people and animals. The gum the V. karroo was exported as a confectionary in the past as “Cape Gum”. The gum is similar to gum Arabic. The bark contains tannin which is used to tan leather to a reddish colour. The hard wood is an excellent firewood and charcoal, and is also used for fencing posts. A tough rope can be made from the inner bark of the tree. The gum, bark and leaves have been used in cold remedies as well as to help eye and wound infections.
The tree is as forage and fodder for domestic and wild animals.

This tree was known for many years as Acacia karroo. It is widespread throughout southern Africa. 

The Sweet Thorn is a small to medium-sized tree which grows to height of 12m where there is good water. It is a tree of open woodland and wooded grassland, but can grow in very dry conditions.
The tree is easily recognised by its distinctive long white paired thorns and coffee coloured bark. The leaves are finely textured and dark green. The bark is red on young branches, darkening and becoming rough with age. Sometimes an attractive reddish colour can be seen in the deep bark fissures. Small birds like to build their nests in the densely thorny branches, as the thorns offer excellent protection from predators.The abundant yellow flowers appear in early summer, or after good rains. The seed pods are narrow, flat and crescent shaped. The flowers appear in early summer in a mass of yellow pompons. Many insects visit and pollinate these flowers. The seed pods are flat and crescent shaped.

A tall evergreen tree with sharply pointed dark green leathery leaves and thin smooth bark. The fleshy, edible, yellow fruits take a year to ripen. The Yellowwood is a protected tree.

The Outeniqua yellowwood is the ‘Big Tree’ in the Knysna forest, reaching up to 60 m in height. Yellowwoods occur from the southern Cape to the Limpopo and also into Mozambique.
The wood is valuable and its growth rate and properties compare favourably to the exotic pine tree. It makes magnificent furniture and is highly sought after for boat-building, floorboards and roof beams. The bark is used for tanning leather and the sap is used to aid chest complaints.

Archaeologically, the resin of the tree was combined with other ingredients to glue arrow-heads to shafts for hunting weapons. When heated to a certain temperature the adhesive becomes brittle and will break under pressure, leaving a poisoned arrow-tip in the wounded animal.

The words Podos means foot, and karpos means fruit (Greek), alluding to the fruits that are produced on fleshy stalks.

The link shaft broke the flight from the tip, preventing the wounded animal from rubbing the arrow out against a tree. The tip worked its way deeper into the flesh and allowed the poison to take effect.

Stone tools have been used for millions of years and show how hominin behaviour and cognitive abilities have changed over time. Our ancestors probably used an array of simple tools made from wood and bone, but stones are the only artefacts that have preserved over a long period of time. They are therefore important in tracing the emergence of technology in human evolution.

EJ;GRQVMb2xaxA;[placeholder - to be updated] The San Trance Dance;"""A rare recording of the San Trance Dance""";;;;;;;;;
Hello438;IMG_6490.JPG;Axis Mundi;"""This conceptual piece speaks to the tiered cosmos in San religious thought. Termites emerge from the mound and ascend into the heavens along the axis mundi in the form of a tree. As they ascend, they transform into therianthropic (part human, part animal) creatures. These wooden creatures are derived from San rock paintings and they are sculpted in a flattened relief, remaining faithful to the original two-dimensional artworks. 

Landscapes were meaningful and complex places for the San living in the past, as they are for those San still living today. Small, inconspicuous and even invisible features of landscape, such as shallow water pans, low rocky outcrops and termite mounds were also seen as important. These places allowed access to the spirit world. The supernatural world is described, paradoxically, as being both below ground and in the sky above. Only certain San ritual specialists, known as owners-of-energy, can enter this alternative world. Once there, they encounter strange animals, the spirits of dead friends and relatives, and, on occasion, god. In turn, certain inhabitants of the spirit realm can visit this world by emerging from the same points of entry used by ritual specialists. It is particularly during the trance dance that movement between the two worlds is facilitated.

Many of the experiences reported by San in trance may seem strange and peculiar. For example, some report that they change into animal-form during the dance. This experience of transformation is often depicted in rock art. Images of therianthropes – part human, part animal – are abundant in rock art sites throughout southern Africa. While seemingly peculiar, this type of experience is reported by people throughout the world when in a state of trance.

Hello457;Veronique Tadjo.jpg;From Abidjun to Joburg by Véronique Tadjo;"""In 2008 Véronique Tadjo exhibited her visual arts works at the Origins Centre temporary gallery. The exhibition “From Abidjan to Joburg” explored the connectedness that exists between cultures and identities. By borrowing from different cultural traditions, Tadjo allows us to see the complex and dynamic nature
of our past and present.

Véronique Tadjo is a writer, poet, novelist, and artist from Côte d'Ivoire. She uses a literary term to describe her style: magical realism. This is the desire to look beyond the visible to get at the essence of our human experience. Forms are primal; they are charged with symbolism and emotion.

Tadjo uses oil sticks and acrylic for her paintings on canvas or on wood. Her colours have the vibrant quality of light in West Africa. Her themes have been influenced both by her life in Johannesburg and by memories of home.

Hello459;Colin Richards A Fine Line.jpg;A Fine Line nu Colin Richards;"""A Fine Line is an exhibition of works by Colin Richards (1954 -2012) that links his early experience as a medical illustrator with his later practice a fine artist.   Richards was renowned in both spheres, as he was for his scholarship, teaching and art therapy and the humanistic values he espoused in all his endeavours. In the exhibition examples of Richards’s medical illustrations are placed in relation to works in which ambiguity and the imagination are given free rein.  All reflect the technical and conceptual virtuosity for which Richards is so esteemed, and his signature labour-intensive, painstakingly detailed, meticulous art practice. The medical illustrations also reflect the importance of drawing ‘by hand’ in scientific research of the time; there were parts of anatomy and the specimen that the camera could not access or capture and which only the human hand could render.  Digital technology has since all but replaced the hand, and these illustrations are testament to a now distant era of medical illustration. 

The exhibition was part of the conference on medical humanities, Body Knowledge, hosted by Wiser (Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research).
Curated by Penny Siopis. 
The exhibition ran from 16 August – 2 September 2012.""";Colin Richards;South Africa;2012;Fine Art Illustration;Fine Art;Prints;Origins Centre;https://www.wits.ac.za/origins/;Origins Centre, University of the Witwatersrand

The exhibition “From Abidjan to Joburg” explored the connectedness that exists between cultures and identities. By borrowing from different cultural traditions, Tadjo allows us to see the complex and dynamic nature
of our past and present.

Véronique Tadjo is a writer, poet, novelist, and artist from Côte d'Ivoire. She uses a literary term to describe her style: magical realism. This is the desire to look beyond the visible to get at the essence of our human experience. Forms are primal; they are charged with symbolism and emotion.

Tadjo uses oil sticks and acrylic for her paintings on canvas or on wood. Her colours have the vibrant quality of light in West Africa. Her themes have been influenced both by her life in Johannesburg and by memories of home.

The arrow could not kill on impact. Instead, the San constructed a complex tri-sectional arrow: consisting of a flight, a poisoned tip and a tapered link-shaft. On impact, the poisoned tip pierced the skin. The link shaft broke the flight from the tip, preventing the wounded animal from rubbing the arrow out against a tree. The tip worked its way deeper into the flesh and allowed the poison to take effect.

Hello554;20210806_135844_HDR.jpg;Gold beads from Mapungubwe;"""While there were local headmen in southern Africa amongst early farmer groups, large-scale chieftanships only appeared after 1000 AD. They occurred first in the Limpopo Valley where large urban centres developed - some with as many as 1500 inhabitants. Ultimately, this led to the rise of Mapungubwe in the 1220s. Mapungubwe was southern Africa's first royal residence, encircled by a town with perhaps as many as 5000 inhabitants. It is likely that the sudden growth of power was spurred by the new trade links and control of trade with the East African coast. 

Significantly, the royal palace shifted from the valley floor to the hilltop, which was regarded as where communication with the ancestors or rain-making could take place. This step placed the king in a position of religious leadership; he now had control over spiritual forces through his special relationship with the ancestors and with god. This new level of spiritual authority probably gave the king ultimate control over all spiritual matters within his territory, including initiation ceremonies.

Yet, the flying antelope, some half-human and some bleeding from the nose, suggest that this is more than a hunt for meat - it is a hunt for the supernatural energy within the eland.

BROOM CLUSTER FIG

BESEM-TROSVY

The broom cluster fig is a rock-splitting, shade tree that reaches up to 35 m. It is found alongside rivers and waterways in northern and eastern South Africa, and all the way up to North Africa.

The fruits produced in summer are very sweet and are consumed fresh or as jam.
The wood of the trunk is used traditionally as part of a fire-lighting kit and for making mortars, drums, brake blocks, and bed boards. The inner bark is used to make rope. The white latex from the live growth areas of the plant is used for treating lung and throat ailments. It is also used to encourage milk production in cows.

Like other fig trees, this one relies on a symbiotic relationship with a specific wasp species which, while laying eggs inside the fig, collects pollen and pollinates other “fruit” of the same species.

WILD DAGGA
UMCWILI
DUIWELS TABAK

A fast growing shrub with erect, branched stems with bright orange ball-shaped flowers that are nectar-rich. Although not related to Cannabis, it produces a mild sedated intoxication, and is smoked medicinally for epilepsy.

Wild dagga is a robust shrub that grows almost anywhere in South Africa.

Many sunbirds feed on the copious nectar in the aptly tubular orange or white flowers thereby pollinating the plant. The plant also attracts ants, bees, and butterflies.

Wild dagga is used to treat headaches, coughs, asthma, dysentery, fever, haemorrhoids, snakebites, tapeworm, and is used traditionally as a snake repellent. It also treats gall sickness in livestock. It is both an anti-nociceptive, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory, but is dangerous in large doses. 

The name Leonotis is derived from the Greek words leon meaning lion and -otis meaning ear. This refers to the upper lips of each flower that resemble a lion’s ear.
